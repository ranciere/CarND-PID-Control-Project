## Reflection

### Effect of Parameters

The proportional gain Kp is responsible for reaching the set point. Too much proportional gain leads to oscillations, too low gain leads to slow control process.

The derivative gain Kd is responsible for avoiding overshooting and oscillations. The downside that it is amplifying noise of the error signal (eg. small changes in the error signal may cause big interfering).

The integral gain Ki integrates error over time, so it is responsible for eliminating system bias.

### Implementation
The original implementation of PID class has been refactored because the two update steps are unjustified: the `UpdateError` and the `TotalError` methods are merged into a single `update` method. This method gets the error and in one step it computes the output and sets the internal state (integral term and derivative term). The implementation is straightforward.

### Tuning
Based on [Implementing PID controllers](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep567/10wi/lectures/Lecture9.pdf), I choose Heuristic Procedire #3 (Page 17). Steps:
1. Set Kd and Ki to 0.0
2. Increase Kp until oscillation:
    * Kp = 0.26 &rarr; Kc = Kp = 0.26; Pc = 66 cycles
3. Set **Kp** = 0.5*Kc = 0.5*0.26 = **0.13**
4. Set **Kd** = Kp * Pc / 8 = 0.13 * 40 / 8 = **1.0725**
5. Set **Ki** = 2*Kp / Pc = 2*0.13 / 66 = **3.94E-03**

During the debugging it turned out that the integral term is prone to saturate in the begining of the running (until the car has not yet reached the cruising speed); so the `update` method limits the integral term (`pid.cpp`: 12-14 lines).

* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
